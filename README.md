# Gabe's new dotfiles | [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sykesgabri/dotfiles2) | [Github](https://github.com/sykesgabri/dotfiles2)

This repo contains my most recent set of dotfiles, specifically for i3. My previous dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/sykesgabri/dotfiles).

I use these dotfiles on Arch, and as such will be referencing pacman commands, the AUR, and how packages are named in Arch's repos specifically. If you're wanting to set my dotfiles up on something that isn't Arch based, keep this in mind.

## Stuff you'll need, and my preferred programs:

### Stuff you can get from pacman:
- Git
- Stow
- wget
- unzip
- i3 Window Manager
- i3lock
- arandr
- Rofi
- Polybar
- Nitrogen
- Alacritty
- zsh
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- Starship
- Fastfetch
- Noto Fonts CJK
- lxsession
- nwg-look
- papirus-icon-theme
- Picom
- playerctl
- python-distutils-extra
- Neovim
- Flameshot
- Thunar
- Flatpak

Here's a massive pacman command to install all this stuff:
```
sudo pacman -S --needed git stow wget unzip i3-wm i3lock arandr rofi polybar nitrogen alacritty zsh zsh-syntax-highlighting starship fastfetch noto-fonts-cjk lxsession nwg-look papirus-icon-theme picom playerctl python-distutils-extra neovim flameshot thunar flatpak
```

### Stuff you can't get from pacman:

#### Yay:
```
cd ~
mkdir --parent .gitclones/AUR && cd .gitclones/AUR
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay
makepkg -si
```

#### zscroll:
```
yay -S zscroll-git
```

#### BetterControl:
```
yay -S better-control-git
```

#### polybar-spotify:
```
cd ~
mkdir .gitclones && cd .gitclones
git clone https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify
```
NOTE: May require some tweaking depending on your setup. For example, in my case, I have to modify the playerctl commands in the bash scripts to look for "chromium" because I use Tidal instead of Spotify.

#### HurmitMono Nerd Font:
```
mkdir --parent ~/Downloads/Hurmit
cd ~/Downloads/Hurmit
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/Hermit.zip
unzip Hermit.zip
rm -rf Hermit.zip
cd ..
sudo mv Hurmit/ /usr/share/fonts
```
#### Whichever Stream Deck software you prefer:
```
# OpenDeck
flatpak install flathub me.amankhanna.opendeck

# StreamController
flatpak install flathub com.core447.StreamController
```
NOTE: Install one or the other, not both at once. You don't need either if you don't own an Elgato Stream Deck.

#### Catppuccin Mocha Mauve GTK Theme:
```
mkdir ~/.themes
cd ~/.themes
wget https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/releases/download/v1.0.3/catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard+default.zip
wget https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/releases/download/v0.7.5/Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Mauve-Dark.zip
unzip catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard+default.zip
unzip Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Mauve-Dark.zip
mv Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Mauve-Dark/gtk-2.0 catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard+default/
rm -rf catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard+default.zip
rm -rf Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Mauve-Dark.zip
rm -rf Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Mauve-Dark/
```
NOTE: Set theme with nwg-look for GTK3/4 and lxappearance for GTK2, the download of two releases and moving of files happens because for whatever reason, the gtk-2.0 folder was removed after release 0.7.5.

#### Catppuccin Mocha Mauve Papirus Folders:
```
cd ~
mkdir --parent .gitclones/catppuccin && cd .gitclones/catppuccin
git clone https://github.com/catppuccin/papirus-folders.git
cd papirus-folders
sudo cp -r src/* /usr/share/icons/Papirus
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders/master/papirus-folders && chmod +x ./papirus-folders
./papirus-folders -C cat-mocha-mauve --theme Papirus-Dark
```
NOTE: Set icon theme with nwg-look.

#### Catppuccin Mocha Mauve Cursors:
```
yay -S catppuccin-cursors-mocha
```
NOTE: Set cursor theme with nwg-look.

#### Floorp:
```
flatpak install flathub one.ablaze.floorp
```

## Installation:

1. Install the various things listed above.
2. Clone this repo into your home directory, and cd into it:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sykesgabri/dotfiles2
mv dotfiles2 .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
```
3. Use Stow to create symlinks from the repo to your home directory:
```
stow .
```
NOTE: If you get a `Stowing . would cause conflicts` error, it is because there is a file in your home directory with the same name and location as a file in the dotfiles. Simply `rm -rf` the directories listed as conflicting, making sure you remove the ones in your home directory, not the dotfiles.

## Setting up Floorp the way I like it:

I have not included an unencrypted version of my Floorp profile folder in the dots, I've done this for the sake of being careful. In lieu of that folder, I'll just document how Floorp is set up on all my computers regardless of type or OS. My settings are fairly strict, and I make use of a good number of extensions, you may wish to do stuff differently, this is just how I do it.

NOTE: These screenshots are from Firefox, when I was still using that. I'm on Floorp now, but I'll keep these screenshots here because the settings are 99% the same, with only a handful of extra things added by Floorp.

Set all permissions to auto disallow (you can still manually enable them on a per site basis when needed), and autoplay to block audio and video.

No syncing, no importing from previous browser, set Floorp to default browser.

## If you are not me, read this:

Some parts of these dotfiles will be very specific to my setup, which is probably not the exact same as yours. Assuming you are not me, here's a list of some configs you may want to change:

- The .sh files in .screenlayout/ correspond to my monitor setup. I strongly recommend deleting them and using arandr to create a .sh file for your monitor setup. Ensure that whatever you name it is reflected in the exec command at the bottom of .config/i3/config so that it is automatically executed when you log in.

- The script in .autostart changes the keyboard layout to UK Mac and forces keycode 49 (the key to the left of 1 on my Keychron K2 HE) to be ยง #. If this script executes, simply unplugging and replugging your keyboard is enough to reset things back to default. Assuming you don't have a UK Mac layout Keychron K2 HE, you'll want to delete that script and the exec command that triggers it in i3.

- You may wish to remove various exec commands from the end of the i3 config. The top one prevents the screen from going to sleep. The rest correspond to various programs, some of which you may not use. Just don't delete the ones for lxsession, picom, the .screenlayout/ script, polybar, and nitrogen.

## If you are me:

Your encrypted Floorp profile is in the scripts folder even though it isn't a script, just to make sure Stow ignores it. Decrypt it with `openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in floorp-profile_2025-07-06.enc -out floorp-profile_2025-07-06.tar.gz`, you'll know the encryption key.
